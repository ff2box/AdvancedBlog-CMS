## What are We Building?

We are going to build an Advanced Blog/ CMS from Start to Finish ,  We will be building forums, authentication, donations, blogging and more  

## What technology are we Using?


- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/) is a free, open-source PHP web framework, created by Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern and based on Symfony..
- [Vue js ](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) (commonly referred to as Vue ) is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/) is an open source CSS framework based on Flexbox and used by more than 100,000 developers.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a technology company. Its software allows individuals and businesses to receive payments over the Internet.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. 

## What Skill Level is this Designed for?

Intermediate to Advanced. You should know HTML/CSS/JS pretty well and already have a good understanding of basic Laravel and vue js .
